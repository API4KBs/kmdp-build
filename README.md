# kmdp-build

Package repository. 

Uses GitHub Actions to run a full build of all the develop branches of the KMDP implementation
(see the script here for local builds https://github.com/API4KBs/API4KBs.github.io/blob/master/scripts/build-develop.sh)

Contrast to https://github.com/API4KBs/api4kp-dist, which builds the OMG platform-independent models (UML, OWL, OpenAPI, XSD)
